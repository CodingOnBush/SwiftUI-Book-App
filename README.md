# Projet4AApp
## Introduction
Welcome to my Projet4A. It's a SwiftUI App ( 2nd iOS app of my life ) that allows you to store your books. I used the google books api to research books. I used the famous [KingFisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) and [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) libraries.

## Instructions followed
  * Git flow
  * MVVM architecture
  * Data persistence with CoreData
  * Clean architecture
  * Api rest
  * List of element (Books)
  * SwiftUI and Swift

## Functionalities with images
At the begining I wanted to create an app to track my reading speed with a chronometer in the app and indicate you your current page at the end of a reading session. To deliver a clean and functional work I have chosen to create an app to only store books. It's a student project for my 4th year of engineering at ESIEA France.
